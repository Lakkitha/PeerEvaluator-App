# An AI-based Evaluation and Progress Tracking System for Public Speaking

## Overview

This project is an innovative approach to enhancing public speaking skills through AI-driven evaluations and progress tracking. Designed for public speaking clubs like Toastmasters, the system addresses the limitations of traditional peer evaluation methods by providing structured, unbiased feedback and visualizing speakers' progress.

The core product is an Android application developed using **React Native**, which integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze speeches and deliver meaningful insights for personal development.
